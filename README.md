# FLASHING-OF-LEDS-WITH-LPC-1768

# AIM: 
   To interface and toggle the led with ARM LPC 1768 microprocessor           
           
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
##  HARDWARE:
ARM LPC1768
LED
## SOFTWARE:
KEIL MICRO VISION 4.0 IDE

# PROCEDURE:
⮚	Open the Keil software and select the New uvision project from Project Menu as shown below.
⮚	Browse to your project folder and provide the project name and click on save.

⮚	Once the project is saved a new pop up “Select Device for Target” opens, Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) from NXP (founded by philips) and click on OK.
⮚	Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) and click on OK.

⮚	As LPC1768 needs the startup code, click on Yes option to include the LPC17xx Startup file.
⮚	Create a new file by file → new to write the program.

⮚	Type the code.

⮚	After typing the code save the file as main.c eg. (abc.c).

⮚	Right click target and Add the suitable files to source group1 and header.
 
⮚	Add the main.c along with system_LPC17xx.c.

⮚	Build the project and fix the compiler errors/warnings if any.

⮚	Code is compiled with no errors. The .bin file is still not generated.
⮚	Right Click on Target Options to select the option for generating .bin file.

⮚	Set IROM1 start address as 0x2000. Bootloader will be stored from 0x0000-0x2000 so application should start from 0x2000

⮚	Write	the	command	to	generate	the .bin file	from
.axf file 
Command: fromelf --bin projectname.axf --output filename.bin
⮚	in c/c++ → include paths → desktop (00-libfiles).

⮚	.Bin file is generated after a rebuild.

⮚	Check the project folder for the generated .Bin file.

# PROGRAM:
```
#include <lpc17xx.h> 
#include "delay.h" //User defined library which conatins the delay routines 
#include "gpio.h" 
#define LED P1_29 // Led is connected to P1.29 
/* start the main program */ 
int main() 
{ 
  SystemInit(); //Clock and PLL configuration 
  GPIO_PinFunction(LED,PINSEL_FUNC_0); // Configure Pin for Gpio 
  GPIO_PinDirection(LED,OUTPUT); // Configure the pin as OUTPUT 
  GPIO_PinWrite(LED,LOW); 
  while(1) 
 { 
  /* Turn On all the leds and wait for 100ms */ 
  GPIO_PinWrite(LED,HIGH); // Make all the Port pin as high 
  DELAY_ms(100); 
 
  GPIO_PinWrite(LED,LOW); // Make all the Port pin as low 
  DELAY_ms(100); 
 } 
}
```
